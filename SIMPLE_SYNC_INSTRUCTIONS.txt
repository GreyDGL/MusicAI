SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYNCING MUSIC EVALUATIONS
==================================================

This system lets you evaluate AI-generated music and share your comments with your collaborator.
All your evaluations are automatically saved and can be synced through GitHub.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
----------------------
- You evaluate music through a web interface (like a website)
- Your evaluations and comments are saved in a database file
- GitHub helps sync this database between you and your collaborator
- Think of it like Google Drive, but for this project

In Terminal, type these (replace with your actual name and email):

DAILY USE - SUPER SIMPLE
------------------------

Starting Your Day:
-----------------
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: cd and drag your MusicAI folder onto Terminal, press Enter
3. Type: git pull (this gets any new evaluations from your collaborator)
4. Type: python app.py
5. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080
6. Start evaluating music!

Ending Your Day:
----------------
1. Close your browser
2. In Terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the app
3. Type these commands one by one:
   git add .
   git commit -m "My evaluations from today"
   git push
4. Tell your collaborator new evaluations are ready

HOW TO EVALUATE MUSIC
---------------------
1. Click "Evaluate" in the menu
2. Select a music file
3. Listen to it
4. Rate each aspect (1-5 stars):
   - Melodic Content
   - Instrumentation
   - Rhythmic Structure
   - Mood Alignment
   - Audio Quality
   - Overall Rating
5. Add your comments in the text boxes
6. Click "Submit Evaluation"

Your comments are automatically saved!

WHAT YOUR COLLABORATOR SEES
----------------------------
When your collaborator runs "git pull", they get:
- All your ratings (the stars you gave)
- All your written comments
- Any new music files you generated

They can then:
- View your evaluations in the Dashboard
- Export all data for analysis
- Add their own evaluations

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
------------------------

"Command not found" error:
- Make sure you installed Git (Step 1)
- Restart Terminal and try again

"Permission denied" error:
- Make sure your collaborator added you as a collaborator
- Check you're using the right GitHub account

Can't see the website:
- Make sure you typed: python app.py
- The website only works at: http://localhost:8080
- Try refreshing the page

Application won't start:
- Make sure Python is installed
- Try: python3 app.py (instead of python app.py)

QUICK REFERENCE CARD
--------------------
Copy this and keep it handy:

MORNING ROUTINE:
cd [drag MusicAI folder here]
git pull
python app.py
→ Go to http://localhost:8080

EVENING ROUTINE:
→ Press Ctrl+C in Terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Today's evaluations"
git push

REMEMBER
--------
- Always "pull" before starting (gets updates)
- Always "push" when done (shares your work)
- Your comments are in the database.db file
- The music files are in the music/ folder
- Everything syncs through GitHub automatically
